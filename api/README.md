# Back-End

## Environment settings

- To begin with the configuration of this environment (back-end) I am going to assume that you already have the * .env * file in your local created and configured, as explained before.

1. Run the following commands:

    - Install dependencies:
        ```
        npm install
        ```

    - Start running the server:
        ```
        npm run dev
        ```
